#MorseCode
This is a simple script to convert single words from morse code to english and vice versa. 

All entries in morse code use a series a periods (.) for dots and underscores (_) for dashes and all morse letters need to have a following space.

At this point the code only accepts single word entries consisting of only letters.

Next steps:
- adding capability to input and translate numbers, non-alphanumeric characters, and multi-word entries.
- Creating and referencing a library with definitions of all applicable non- and alphanumeric characters.
